/* Explanation
* Have a better understanding about the Coordinate Frame Conventions for camera :http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0103.html
* Now consider a point inside the point cloud and imagaine that point is formed on a XY plane where the perpendicular 
* distance from the plane to the camera is Z. 
* The perpendicular drawn from the camera to the plan hits at center of the XY plane 
* Also now we have the x and y coordinate of the point which is formed on the XY plane.
* Now X is the horizontal axis and Y is the vertical axis
*                             
*
*

*                                  X
*                    _____________________________  
*                   |                             |
*                   |                     *______________Z______________________
*                   |                             |  
*                   |             C|______________________Z_____________________|
*                  Y|              |              |                             | 
*                   |                             | 
*                   |                             | 
*                   |_____________________________|  
*
*
* C is the center of the plane which is Z meter away from the center of camera and * is the point on the plan
* Now we know Z is the perpendicular distance from the point to the camera. 
* If you need to find the  actual distance d from the point to the camera, you shloud calculate the hypotenuse hypot(pt.z, pt.x)
* Angle convention
* to the left of the camera is 0 degree and to the right is 180 degree. Like you stretch both the hands towards sides (deals with X axis). left 0-----|-----180 right (could be other way around, dont have sensor to test)
* to the  bottom of the camera is 0 degree and to the top is 108 degree. 
* angle the point made horizontally min_angle_radx=atan2(pt.z,pt.x);
* angle the point made Verticlly    min_angle_rady=atan2(pt.z, pt.y);
